<!-- <em>Bulbasaur returns for another round of LC as one of the strongest sun sweepers in the metagame alongside Bellsprout and Oddish. However, it stands out from these two, as it is the fastest Chlorophyll sweeper in LC and has more bulk than Bellsprout. It also has access to Growth, giving it an edge over Oddish. However, despite being bulkier than other Chlorophyll sweepers, its bulk is still relatively low, making it difficult to switch it in. Generation VI brought with it changes in weather, leaving Bulbasaur a drastically limited amount of time in which it can sweep. However, it still has the bulk and power to pull off incredible feats and tear through enemy teams.</em> --></div>

<!-- <em>Goomy has a good Special Defense stat and is the only Pokemon in Little Cup with access to Gooey; this is an especially nice ability in Little Cup due to an increased emphasis on Speed tiers. Goomy also has access to Sap Sipper, which lets it take on threats such as Snivy and Bellsprout with ease. It is also one of the very few defensive Dragon-type Pokemon in Little Cup, granting it key resistances to Fire, Water, and Grass. However, poor overall base stats keep Goomy from really shining, and its lackluster Defense holds it back from making full use of Gooey. Goomy is unable to hit very hard off of its poor base 55 Special Attack and thus grants many sweepers the opportunity to set up against it. Goomy also lacks any reliable recovery moves, forcing it to rely on Rest to consistently perform well defensively. Finally, the presence of powerful Fairy-types such as Spritzee on many teams often makes Goomy a liability.</em>--></div>
